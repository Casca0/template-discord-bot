# Template for creating Discord bots

To properly test this template, you need to create a **`.env`** file to store your bot token and your bot client ID, you may store the token as **`DISCORD_TOKEN`** and the client ID as **`CLIENT_ID`**.

***

> This template already has a `event handler` and `command handler`, no need for further configuration, just go create some commands and have fun!

## Running the code

To run the code just type this in your terminal, once you created the `.env` file with your token.

``` bash
$ npm start
```
