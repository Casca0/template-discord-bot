# Template for creating Discord bots

To properly test this template, you need to create a **`.env`** file to store your bot token, you may store it as **`DISCORD_TOKEN`**.

> This template already has a `event handler` and `command handler`, no need for further configuration, just go create some commands and have fun!

***

## Running the code

To run the code just type this in your terminal, once you created the `.env` file with your token.

``` bash
$ npm start
```
